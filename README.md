# AskHistorians

These are an assortment of scripts, bots, and programs that I've written to help out the mod team at r/AskHistorians. For now, there are only two programs; SaveExporter exports saved reddit comments, and DigestBot is a lightweight bot that sends a customizable digest to users. 

As well as those, I've also written some dev tools, such as MessageSender which is a development tool that bulk-sends messages. Please see their respective folders for more info.
